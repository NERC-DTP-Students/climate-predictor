Usage
==========

The usage instructions are the same when running the Python script or the stand alone executable file apart from the different options in step 1. 

1. To launch the GUI:
  + Python: Run 'https//:github.com/NERC-DTP-Students/climate-predictor/main/climatepredictor/gui.py
  + Exe: Double click on the gui icon

2. Once the GUI is running input the initial values and change with time for cloud cover.

3. Choose current and final land coverage using either the sliders or the entry boxes beneath. **Entries in the boxes must be inputted in descending order i.e forest then ice etc.)**

4. Choose timespan to be investigated either using the slider or the input box. If a parameter which has a maximum value (e.g. albedo) is changing with time, the maximum timespan that can be investigated is the time taken for that parameter to reach its maximum value.

5. In the plot options select an x-axis and how many temperatures you want to be displayed.

6. The plot will automatically update.

7. Press save plot to save the plot. The plot will save in the same directory as the GUI application. To alter this just write the relative path you want to save the file to into the entry box. The .png suffix is automatically added.
