Welcome to Climate Predictor's documentation!
=============================================
This documentation is for the 2-Layer Atmosphere Model predicting planet surface temperatures based on cloud cover and CO2. 
See below for How to Start.

Scientific background
------------------------
This TCL and Python lbrary calculates and visualizes planet surface temperatures based on cloud cover and CO2. 

With two layers of atmosphere and a single layer of surface, the sunshine warms the surface without affecting the atmosphere. 
The warm surface then heats the overlying atmosphere by thermal radiation and upward convective heat flux. 

The user can use the sliders to manipulate the cloud cover and the amount of CO2. You can read our GUI and Python codes in this library. 

More detail on this model can be found on: biocycle.atmos.colostate.edu/shiny/2layer
The GUI theme is based on https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme 

Quickstart
-------------------------

1. Run main.py 
2. Use the sidebars.
